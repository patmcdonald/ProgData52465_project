#### This GitHub repository contains my assignment in a Jupyter Notebook file.

#### The [notebook](https://github.com/patmcdonald/ProgData52465_project/blob/master/Programming%20for%20Data%20Analysis%20Project%202018.ipynb) can be read in [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/): Just copy and paste the notebook URL into [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) and it can be read. This is more reliable than using GitHub, as there may be rendering issues, occasionally.

#### To run a Jupyter Notebook on your local machine - follow these [instructions](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html) relevant to your operating system
